# Octocards
## Description
I designed a web application to help visual learners organize their study material into flashcards and tables in a way that makes sense to them. To promote maximum retention, they can then review the content with the program's spaced repetition algorithm. In addition, I have implemented features for users to group their study material into classes and topics.

This application was coded mostly in Python's Django framework, which provided a way to store the user's study material in model classes connected to a SQLite database, and display it in a view. I coded the frontend in CSS, making use of the Bootstrap library.
